# ⚡ MY INTERVIEW PREPARATION PLAN ⚡

This is my homepage for preparation to a software engineer interview.

## How it works
  - Found a good article - identificate the most specific field of the article and add the link there. If you cannot identify a certain field just add the link to About section under the most specific field you can identify.
  - Just learned material from the link. If it was bad–remove the link. If it was OK, just check the checkbox [x] and go further.
  - The main goal of this sheet is to help to prepare to a data engineer (software engineer) interview in a STRUCTURED manner.
  - If you found this somehow and want to use it–just replace "[x]" with "[ ]" and go ahead.
  - Do not afraid to change a structure of any topic.
  - To expand
    - everything: ```Cmd``` + ```K``` + ```J```
    - a particular clause: ```Cmd``` + ```Option (⌥)``` + ```]```
  - To shrink
    - everything: ```Cmd``` + ```K``` + ```0```
    - a particular clause: ```Cmd``` + ```Option (⌥)``` + ```[```

Good luck!
