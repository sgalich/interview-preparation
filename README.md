# ⚡ MY INTERVIEW PREPARATION PLAN ⚡

This is my homepage for preparation to a software engineer interview.
  - [ABOUT](https://github.com/sgalich/interview-preparation/blob/main/0_about.md) <- container for all unsorted materials.
  - [I. ALGORITHMS & DATA STRUCTURES](https://github.com/sgalich/interview-preparation/blob/main/1_algorithms.md)
  - [II. SYSTEM DESIGN](https://github.com/sgalich/interview-preparation/blob/main/2_system_design.md)
  - [III. BEHAVIORAL QUESTIONS](https://github.com/sgalich/interview-preparation/blob/main/3_behavioral.md)

## How it works
  - Found a good article - identificate the most specific field of the article and add the link there. If you cannot identify a certain field just add the link to About section under the most specific field you can identify.
  - Just learned material from the link. If it was bad–remove the link. If it was OK, just check the checkbox [x] and go further.
  - The main goal of this sheet is to help to prepare to a data engineer (software engineer) interview in a STRUCTURED manner.
  - If you found this somehow and want to use it–just replace "[x]" with "[ ]" and go ahead.
  - Do not afraid to change a structure of any topic.
  - To expand (in VSCode)
    - everything: ```Cmd```+```K```+```J```
    - a particular clause: ```Cmd```+```Option (⌥)```+```]```
  - To shrink (in VSCode)
    - everything: ```Cmd```+```K```+```0```
    - a particular clause: ```Cmd```+```Option (⌥)```+```[```

Good luck! And remember –
> Consistency is the key to success
