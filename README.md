# ⚡ MY INTERVIEW PREPARATION PLAN ⚡

This is my homepage for preparation to a software engineer interview.
  0. [ABOUT](https://github.com/sgalich/interview-preparation/blob/main/0_about.md) <- container for all unsorted materials.
  1. [BEHAVIORAL QUESTIONS](https://github.com/sgalich/interview-preparation/blob/main/main.md)
  2. [ALGORITHMS & DATA STRUCTURES](https://github.com/sgalich/interview-preparation/blob/main/main.md)
  3. [SYSTEM DESIGN](https://github.com/sgalich/interview-preparation/blob/main/main.md)

## How it works
  - Found a good article - identificate the most specific field of the article and add the link there. If you cannot identify a certain field just add the link to About section under the most specific field you can identify.
  - Just learned material from the link. If it was bad–remove the link. If it was OK, just check the checkbox [x] and go further.
  - The main goal of this sheet is to help to prepare to a data engineer (software engineer) interview in a STRUCTURED manner.
  - If you found this somehow and want to use it–just replace "[x]" with "[ ]" and go ahead.
  - Do not afraid to change a structure of any topic.
  - To expand
    - everything: ```Cmd``` + ```K``` + ```J```
    - a particular clause: ```Cmd``` + ```Option (⌥)``` + ```]```
  - To shrink
    - everything: ```Cmd``` + ```K``` + ```0```
    - a particular clause: ```Cmd``` + ```Option (⌥)``` + ```[```

Good luck! And remember –
> Consistency is the key to success
