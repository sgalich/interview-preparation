- PERSONAL Q&A
  - [x] Why Tesla?
      - Tesla is not just a usual car manufacturer. Tesla is a great company, which mission is to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy. It means that Tesla is changing the world, making it better. I really want to be a part of your team, work with you and every day make the world better with you.
  - [x] Tell me about yourself?
      - [ ] [1](https://www.themuse.com/advice/tell-me-about-yourself-interview-question-answer-examples)
      - I’m a software engineer at a russian company OTC.ru. I make algorithms, that gather information about purchases all over the russian part of the internet. Also my algorithms process this information and store it in a PostgresQL database. I use python and JavaScript programming languages. I work at this position about 2 years. Before this I attended a programming bootcamp and worked with my own home project, that was a stock exchange trading algorithm. Now I’m looking for new opportunities. I would like to learn more about web development, machine learning techniques and other essential for a serious software developers technologies.
  - [x] What Are Your Greatest Strengths?
      - [ ] [1](https://www.themuse.com/advice/3-smart-strategies-for-answering-whats-your-greatest-strength)
      - I love to work. I’m self-motivated, I just enjoy with writing code and solving software problems.
      - I’m a constant learner. I try to educate myself through the whole of my life.
  - [x] What Do You Consider to Be Your Weaknesses?
      - [x] [1](https://www.themuse.com/advice/4-ways-to-answer-whats-your-biggest-weakness-that-actually-sound-believable)
      - I tend to get caught up in the little details, which can distract me from the ultimate goal. But I work on myself and now I’m trying not to let any detail to take more time than it needed and left it as it is. After the main goal is achieved if I had some time till the deadline I can back to my detail in order to make it perfect.
  - [x] What Is Your Greatest Professional Achievement?
      - [x] [1](https://www.themuse.com/advice/greatest-accomplishment-interview-question-answer-examples)
      - While I’m working at otc.ru I made parsers (algorithms that scraped an information we need from different websites). Once the company decided to run a new service, that should gather b2b sale offers through the country. And I was asked to develop a parser for a website, that was very important for this our new sevice because of a huge amount of b2b adverticements on it. I’ve spent some time, tried different approaches I knew at that moment and nothing worked. That website had a strong protection from parsing, but at the same time it didn’t have an API option. It was a week till the deadline and I should find some way to develop a working parser. So I sat and started to look for any reliable decision «out of the box». And I’ve found out that I can use an auto-testing software with a purpose of parsing. I’d tried a Puppeteer browser and it worked. But there was an issue: I didn’t know how to code with JavaScript. At that moment I started to learn this programming language along with developing a parser’s algorithm. I worked hard and created working algorithm within that week. I’ve nailed that problem and get some knoledge of new programming language, I was unfamiliar with before. After that I continued to learn more complex concepts of JS and I hope my greatest professional achievements will be in the future. I’m working on it constantly.
  - [ ] Tell Me About a Challenge or Conflict You’ve Faced at Work, and How You Dealt With It.

  - [x] Tell Me About a Time You Demonstrated Leadership Skills.
    - I think people demostrate leadership skills when they take a responsibility for the result of the whole team and motivate their coworkers to do something in order to achieve a common goal. I have such experience in my career as a software developer. While I’m working at otc.ru I made parsers (algorithms that scraped an information we need from different websites). I was asked to make parsers, that should scrape an information about purchases by their publication day. Once I was looking through our website with the results of my job and noticed that some of information, that my parsers had gathered, is not the same as in the original source. Then I had made a research and found out that users of the original sources tend to change this information afte they had published a purchase. While we had parsed this purchase only once after it was published, so after a user changed the purchase we had an outdated information on our website. So in order to keep only actual information in our website I initiated a process of changing our method of data extraction, transformation, loading and keeping it in the database. It took some time while our team completely changed the approach of parsing purchases. As the result we get always fresh information on our website and our users began to view these purchases on our webiste more often because they began to trust more to our information.
  - [x] What’s a Time You Disagreed With a Decision That Was Made at Work?
    - While I'm working at OTC.ru we were about to run a new service. I was asked to create about 10 new web parsers in a around a few weekends, so that was quite challenging. We were discussing among colleagues and my boss a structure of keeping information that parsers should bring to a database. There were 10 different websites with different structure of their information. I preferred the hard way - I had thought that a was able to create withing the tight deadline also a processing service that would transofrm data from parsers and store it in the database in the format we need. But my colleagues (that had much more experience than I had) decided opposite. So I created the parsers that store raw information in json format in our database. And concurrently with my work my colleagues developed that service that process this row data in order show this information on our website in the right format. From this story I've learned that perfectionism is not the goal #1. Team work is really much more effective than doing everything by my own hands.
  - [x] Tell Me About a Time You Made a Mistake.
    - I make mistakes every time, even every day. This is a great source of learning for me. I consider my greatest mistake was to choose civil cervant field instead of computer science when I'd finished with my school education. As soon as I realised that it was a mistake I made some efforts to fix it and became a software developer. As a software developer now I'm constantly struggling with bugs and mistakes. And this experience teaches me. Even good working clean and well documented code, that I write–after some amount of time I see mistakes in it. I think, this is a great evidence that I'm moving forward and constantly getting better at programming.
